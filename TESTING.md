# Validation Testing using W3C



# CSS validation

CSS validation is the process of checking your CSS code to ensure it follows the official syntax rules defined by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). 
It helps you catch errors, improve browser compatibility, and write cleaner, more maintainable styles so that other developers can work on your code if required. - W3C

# HTML validation

HTML validation is used to check whether your HTML code follows the official standards and syntax rules defined by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). 
Validating your HTML helps ensure your website works correctly, is accessible, and is easier to maintain. Validating HTML also enhances search engine optimization (SEO) 
and ensures consistent display across different browsers.  - W3C
